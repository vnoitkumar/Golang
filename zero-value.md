# Zero value 

In Go, every type has a zero value, which is the value a variable of that type holds if it hasn't been assigned a value yet. The concept of zero values is fundamental in Go, ensuring that variables are always initialized to a well-defined value, rather than being undefined. Here's a brief overview of the zero values for some common types in Go:

- int, float64, and other numeric types: The zero value is 0.
- bool: The zero value is false.
- string: The zero value is "" (the empty string).
- Pointer types (including slices, maps, channels, and functions): The zero value is nil, indicating that they don't point to any initialized value.
- Structs: The zero value of a struct is a struct with all its fields set to their respective zero values.
